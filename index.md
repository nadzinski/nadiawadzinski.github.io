# About Me

Welcome! I'm a software engineer living in Seattle, Washington, in the
beautiful Pacific Northwest. I'm currently the Senior Staff Engineer for the
Platform Division at <a href="https://www.rover.com/">Rover.com</a>. At the top
of my company's IC ladder, I'm expected to wear a lot of hats. On any given day
you might find me doing distributed systems architecture, writing backend code,
working on big-picture technical strategy, leading major infrastructure projects, 
diving into really hard bugs, or lately, helping our teams build software faster 
and better with agentic AI.

Most recently, I've been diving deep into LLMs and the associated AI tools that
are revolutionizing our industry. I'm my company's expert on AI-assisted
development (Claude Code is a personal favorite) and I've been learning how we can
use these tools effectively and teaching them to engineers across my
company. I've also been building AI Agents and MCP servers for tasks like
diagnosing errors from our logs and metrics. It's made me fall in love
with software and technology all over again and I'm very excited for this new
world that we're opening up.

At Rover, I'm fortunate to get to work with some of my favorite languages and
open source technologies, including Python, Django, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL,
and Kubernetes. My deepest areas of expertise are:

* Distributed Systems Architecture. I'm the kind of engineer who loves an
  opportunity to explain eventual consistency, the CAP Theorem, at-least-once
  delivery, distributed consensus, and more. When I got the opportunity to lead
  a project to redesign my company's http request cycle architecture, we ended
  up both making the site faster and cutting infrastructure spend in half.

* Performance engineering. I love spending time in CPU profilers and looking at
  database query plans. I led an initiative that cut p50 and p95 response times
  _site wide_ by identifying and fixing our largest performance bottlenecks.

* Databases. I once taught a 12 week class on database internals and the Django ORM,
  in which I eventually got pretty good at drawing a B-tree on the whiteboard.

* Observability and Incident Management. One of my favorite hats to wear is my Site
  Reliability Engineer hat. I will happily talk your ear off about the virtues
  of distributed tracing, OpenTelemetry, and structured wide event data.

I view building software as a social process as much as a technical one, and 
I strive to draw together the talents of my team members,
acting as a facilitator and communicator as well as a technical leader. 

As a former professor, I love mentorship and teaching. Guiding other engineers
as they learn and grow helps me see familiar concepts from new perspectives,
and has made me a better engineering leader and a better communicator. I
pride myself on being a lifelong learner: most recently, I've been deepening my
knowledge of Rust and brushing up on probability and statistics.

I grew up in Glasgow, Scotland, and studied physics and mathematics at the
University of Cambridge. After a post-college stint as a software engineer at a
tech startup, I got a PhD in the <a href="history_of_science.html">History of
Science</a> from Princeton University, and then taught history at a liberal
arts college before returning to the tech world. Outside work I enjoy travel,
baking, Texas hold'em poker, reading (history, sci-fi, poetry, russian
novels...), and single malt scotch.
