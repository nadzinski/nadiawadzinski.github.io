# About Me

Welcome! I'm a software engineer living in Seattle, Washington, in the
beautiful Pacific Northwest. I'm currently the Senior Staff Engineer for the
Platform Division at <a href="https://www.rover.com/">Rover.com</a>. At the top
of my company's IC ladder, I wear a lot of hats. On any given day
you might find me doing distributed systems architecture, writing backend code,
working on big-picture technical strategy, leading major infrastructure projects, 
diving into really hard bugs, or lately, helping our teams build software faster 
and better with agentic AI.

Most recently, I've been diving deep into LLMs and the associated AI tools that are
revolutionizing our industry. I'm my company's expert on AI-assisted software
development (Claude Code is a personal favorite) and I've been learning how we
can use these tools effectively and teaching them to other engineers. I've also
been building AI Agents and MCP servers for tasks like diagnosing errors from
logs and metrics. It’s made me fall in love with software and technology all
over again, and I’m incredibly excited about the new world we’re opening up.

At Rover, I'm fortunate to get to work with some of my favorite languages and
open source technologies, including Python, Django, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL,
and Kubernetes. My deepest areas of expertise include:

* **Distributed Systems Architecture.** I'm the kind of engineer who jumps at the
  chance to explain eventual consistency, the CAP Theorem, at-least-once
  delivery, distributed consensus, and more. I’ve owned production systems
  handling thousands of queries per second and hundreds of thousands of active
  users. When I led a project to redesign my company's HTTP request cycle
  architecture, we ended up cutting infrastructure costs in half.

* **Performance Engineering.** I love spending time in CPU profilers and looking at
  database query plans. I led an initiative that reduced p50 and p95 response times
  by 50% across the entire site by identifying and fixing our biggest
  performance bottlenecks.

* **Databases.** I once taught a 12-week class on database internals and the
  Django ORM, during which I got pretty good at drawing B-trees on the
  whiteboard. Postgres remains my favorite database.

* **Observability and Incident Management.** One of my favorite hats to wear is
  my Site Reliability Engineer hat. I'll happily talk your ear off about the
  virtues of distributed tracing, OpenTelemetry, and structured wide event
  data. I am fascinated by how complex systems fail and I think a good
  blameless incident postmortem is one of the most useful meetings an
  engineering team can have.

I view building software as a social process as much as a technical one, and I
strive to bring out the best in my teammates, acting as a facilitator
and communicator as well as a technical leader. I'm happiest when I can be the
catalyst on big projects, creating conditions for engineers to do their best
work. I often say that every staff engineer should be able to think like a
manager, and I always keep the big-picture business impact in mind, even when
I’m solving problems deep in the code.

As a former professor, I'm passionate about mentorship and teaching. Guiding other engineers
as they learn and grow helps me see familiar concepts from new perspectives,
and it's made me a better engineering leader and a better communicator. I
pride myself on being a lifelong learner. Most recently, I've been deepening my
knowledge of Rust and brushing up on probability and statistics.

I grew up in Glasgow, Scotland, and studied physics and mathematics at the
University of Cambridge. After a stint as an engineer at a
tech startup, I earned a PhD in the <a href="history_of_science.html">History of
Science</a> from Princeton University, then taught history at a liberal
arts college before returning to the tech world. Outside work, I enjoy travel,
baking, Texas Hold’em poker, reading (history, sci-fi, poetry, Russian
novels...), and single malt Scotch.
