# History of Science / STS Scholarship

I had a previous career in academia, where I taught courses in the History of
Science, European history, and Science and Technology Studies. My research
focused on the history of information and scientific communication, with the
aim being to use the experience of the communications revolution unleashed by
the Internet to ask fresh questions about how people communicated with one
another in the past.

I did my PhD in the History of Science program at Princeton University, where I
wrote 
<a href="https://dataspace.princeton.edu/jspui/handle/88435/dsp018623j113v">a dissertation</a>
on how people doing science during the Napoleonic Wars (c.
1800) shared information with one another. Along the way, I also wrote a couple
of research articles, which you can find in the publications section below.
